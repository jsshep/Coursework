## Jonathan's Project Proposal

###### fivethirtyeight.com did an interesting analysis of the relationship between the prominence of women in a given film (as proxied by Bechtel Test score), and the profitability of that film.
###### I propose taking that analysis one step further by analyzing the amount of time that women speak in a given film. I will do this by analyzing the text of raw movie scripts (http://www.imsdb.com/). I'm hoping to collect enough data on control variables to create a more robust model than using "female speech time" as the sole independent variable of choice. The dependent variable will be gross box office revenue.
